# ActionSpec

> Turn infrastructure specifications into deployable GitHub Actions

**ActionSpec** is an open-source demonstration of YAML-driven Infrastructure as Code, showcasing how specification files can drive GitHub Actions workflows for automated infrastructure deployment.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Demo POC (v0.1.0)**: ✅ Complete - Fully functional self-hosted deployment tool with web UI

This repository contains a **complete proof-of-concept demonstration** of YAML-driven infrastructure deployment. The demo showcases end-to-end workflow from specification editing to automated AWS deployment via GitHub Actions.

**Enterprise Solution (overengineered/PRD.md)**: ~50% Complete - Started Here, Pivoted to POC Mid-Build

**The journey:**
1. Designed ambitious enterprise architecture (see overengineered/PRD.md - serverless React + Lambda)
2. Built foundation: security, parsing, Lambda infrastructure (~1.5 days)
3. **Realization**: Remaining frontend/integration work would take another week+
4. **Decision**: Validate with complete POC before finishing enterprise build
5. **Result**: Shipped working demo (v0.1.0) that proves the entire concept

**Enterprise foundation already built** (~50% complete):
- ✅ Security framework (100%) - Pre-commit hooks, CodeQL, secrets scanning
- ✅ Spec parsing engine (90%) - JSON Schema validation, YAML parser, error handling
- ✅ Lambda infrastructure (100%) - SAM templates, security wrapper, API Gateway scaffold
- ✅ Cost controls (100%) - Budget alarms, remote state, Terraform modules

**Remaining for enterprise** (deferred, not blocked):
- 🚧 GitHub PR integration - Spec applier Lambda (Phase 3.3)
- 🚧 React frontend - Dynamic forms, WAF toggle UI (Phase 3.4)
- 🚧 API Gateway + WAF - CloudFront, static hosting (Phase 2)
- 🚧 Deployment automation & documentation (Phase 3.5)

**Learning:** Should have validated with POC before building enterprise foundation - but the foundation work informed the POC architecture and is ready when enterprise scaling is needed.

**Historical Note** (January 2025): This repository previously contained a partially-built SAM/Lambda implementation and "overengineered" examples to demonstrate what not to do. These were removed as they served their educational purpose but cluttered the repository. The project uses GitHub OAuth exclusively for authentication (GH_TOKEN removed in v0.2.0). See commit `130932d` for deleted content or check CHANGELOG.md for details.

**See the implementation**: The `backend/` directory contains the main implementation. See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for architecture and setup.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This is a **PORTFOLIO DEMONSTRATION PROJECT** showcasing cloud architecture patterns.

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**
- Educational and demonstration purposes only
- No warranty or support provided
- You are responsible for all AWS charges
- Review all code before deployment

## 🎯 Features

- **YAML specifications drive all infrastructure** - Change a spec file, deploy infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions automation built-in** - GitOps workflow out of the box
- **AWS WAF deployment with one config change** - Security-first design
- **Cost-optimized for demos** - <$5/month passive costs
- **Security-first design** - Automated scanning and pre-commit hooks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS account (recommend dedicated demo account)
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- AWS credentials configured as repository secrets

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec.git
   cd action-spec
   ```

2. **Install pre-commit hooks** (REQUIRED for contributors)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
   ```

   This installs security validation that runs before each commit to prevent accidental exposure of:
   - AWS credentials and account IDs
   - Private IP addresses
   - Terraform state files
   - Environment configuration

3. **Test the hook**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
   ```

4. **Make changes and commit** - hooks validate automatically
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your changes"
   # Pre-commit hook runs automatically
   ```

## 🛡️ Security

This project implements multiple layers of security validation:

- **Pre-commit hooks** - Local validation before code enters Git history
- **GitHub Actions scanning** - TruffleHog secret detection + pattern validation
- **CodeQL analysis** - Static code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates

See [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) for reporting security issues.
