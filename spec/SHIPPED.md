# Shipped Features

## Bootstrap CSW Workflow Infrastructure
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Branch**: feature/bootstrap
- **Commit**: cf517bc
- **PR**: https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/pull/1
- **Summary**: Validate CSW installation and commit workflow infrastructure to repository
- **Key Changes**:
  - Validated CSW directory structure (all required files present)
  - Validated spec/README.md content and workflow documentation
  - Validated spec/stack.md configuration for TypeScript + React + Vite
  - Validated spec/template.md structure (all 8 sections present)
  - Validated bootstrap spec follows template correctly
  - Documented expected limitations (validation commands can't run without npm project)
- **Validation**:  All checks passed (6/6 validation tasks completed)

### Success Metrics
-  Directory structure matches spec/README.md documentation - **Result**: All required files and directories exist and are properly structured
-  Template can be copied to create new specs - **Result**: spec/template.md contains all 8 required sections and is ready for use
-  This bootstrap spec itself gets shipped to SHIPPED.md - **Result**: Successfully shipped via PR #1
-  First hands-on experience with CSW workflow completed successfully - **Result**: Complete /plan � /build � /ship workflow executed successfully

**Overall Success**: 100% of metrics achieved (4/4)

**Notes**: This is the first feature shipped through CSW workflow. Validation commands in stack.md are defined but cannot execute until npm project is initialized in a future spec. This is expected behavior for infrastructure-only bootstrap.

## Open Source Project Setup
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Branch**: feature/active-oss-project-setup
- **Commit**: 26453af
- **PR**: https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/pull/2
- **Summary**: Complete OSS documentation and configuration infrastructure following claude-spec-workflow patterns
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added LICENSE (MIT, DevOps To AI LLC dba TrakRF)
  - Added CONTRIBUTING.md (infrastructure-specific contribution guidelines)
  - Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.1)
  - Added SECURITY.md (demo project security policy)
  - Added CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format)
  - Added .envrc (direnv configuration)
  - Added .env.local.example (AWS + GH_TOKEN template, no secrets)
  - Added .gitignore (comprehensive: Node + OpenTofu/Terraform + AWS)
  - Added .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md (infrastructure-focused)
  - Updated spec/stack.md (added maturity declaration)
- **Validation**: ✅ All checks passed

### Success Metrics
- ✅ **8+ OSS documentation files created** - **Result**: 10 files created (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, .envrc, .env.local.example, .gitignore, bug template, stack.md update)
- ✅ **Zero secrets in repository** - **Result**: Validated with grep scans, no tokens or keys committed
- ✅ **All links point to correct repository** - **Result**: 5 trakrf/action-spec URLs verified, no claude-spec-workflow links
- ✅ **Passes GitHub's community standards check** - **Result**: All required OSS files present

**Overall Success**: 100% of immediate metrics achieved (4/4)

**Notes**: This completes Phase 0 (Project Setup) from PRD.md. All OSS boilerplate follows claude-spec-workflow patterns but customized for infrastructure projects. Security validation confirmed no secrets committed. Ready for Phase 1 (Security Foundation).

## Security Automation Setup
- **Date**: 2025-10-21
- **Branch**: feature/security-automation-setup
- **Commit**: aa5f6ca
- **PR**: https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/pull/3
- **Summary**: Establish comprehensive automated security scanning for CI/CD pipeline
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (TruffleHog + pattern checks)
  - Added `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (minimal CodeQL foundation)
  - Added `.github/dependabot.yml` (dependency monitoring for github-actions)
  - Updated `SECURITY.md` with automation documentation and local testing instructions
  - Created Security Hall of Fame section for responsible disclosure
  - Configured pattern checks for AWS account IDs and private IP addresses
- **Validation**: ✅ All YAML files pass syntax validation

### Success Metrics

**Immediate**:
- ✅ **3 security workflows active** - **Result**: security-scan.yml (2 jobs: secret-scanning + pattern-check), codeql.yml, dependabot.yml configured
- ✅ **100% PR coverage** - **Result**: All workflows trigger on pull_request events to main branch
- ⏳ **Zero false positives in first week** - **Result**: To be measured post-merge (patterns are specific: 12-digit numbers, RFC 1918 IPs)
- ⏳ **Dependabot PR within 7 days** - **Result**: To be measured (github-actions monitoring active)

**Long-term**:
- ⏳ **Zero secrets merged to main** - **Result**: TruffleHog will catch accidental commits (measured ongoing)
- ⏳ **Dependency CVEs addressed within 2 weeks** - **Result**: Process metric, measured over time
- ⏳ **Security documentation viewed** - **Result**: GitHub insights tracking (post-merge)

**Overall Success**: 50% of immediate metrics achieved (2/4), 50% pending measurement post-merge

**Notes**: Consolidates Phase 1 tasks #1 and #2 from PRD.md (lines 441). This is configuration-only (no code yet), so traditional validation gates (lint, typecheck, test, build) don't apply. Validation was YAML syntax checking. CodeQL workflow created but languages not configured yet - will enable in Phase 2/3 when Python/JS code exists. Dependabot configured for github-actions only; npm/pip sections ready for future. Follow-up: Add security-scan as required status check after first workflow run.
