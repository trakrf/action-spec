# Shipped Features

## Bootstrap CSW Workflow Infrastructure
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Branch**: feature/bootstrap
- **Commit**: cf517bc
- **PR**: https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/pull/1
- **Summary**: Validate CSW installation and commit workflow infrastructure to repository
- **Key Changes**:
  - Validated CSW directory structure (all required files present)
  - Validated spec/README.md content and workflow documentation
  - Validated spec/stack.md configuration for TypeScript + React + Vite
  - Validated spec/template.md structure (all 8 sections present)
  - Validated bootstrap spec follows template correctly
  - Documented expected limitations (validation commands can't run without npm project)
- **Validation**:  All checks passed (6/6 validation tasks completed)

### Success Metrics
-  Directory structure matches spec/README.md documentation - **Result**: All required files and directories exist and are properly structured
-  Template can be copied to create new specs - **Result**: spec/template.md contains all 8 required sections and is ready for use
-  This bootstrap spec itself gets shipped to SHIPPED.md - **Result**: Successfully shipped via PR #1
-  First hands-on experience with CSW workflow completed successfully - **Result**: Complete /plan ’ /build ’ /ship workflow executed successfully

**Overall Success**: 100% of metrics achieved (4/4)

**Notes**: This is the first feature shipped through CSW workflow. Validation commands in stack.md are defined but cannot execute until npm project is initialized in a future spec. This is expected behavior for infrastructure-only bootstrap.
