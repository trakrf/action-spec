# Build Log: Archive Overengineered Implementation

## Session: 2025-10-30T11:10:00
Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 7

## Context Loaded
- ✅ spec.md: Requirements for archiving overengineered implementation
- ✅ plan.md: 7 tasks with git mv operations and README creation
- ✅ stack.md: Python backend validation (black, mypy, pytest)
- ✅ README.md: Workflow philosophy and standards

## Implementation Strategy
This is a file organization task with critical documentation deliverable:
- Primary: Create compelling README explaining the engineering judgment
- Secondary: Preserve git history via git mv commands
- Validation: File structure checks, not code tests

## Approach
1. Create directory structure first
2. Move files with git mv for history preservation
3. Update cross-references in main README.md
4. Write explanatory README (the critical deliverable)
5. Comprehensive verification

### Task 1: Create Archive Directory Structure
Started: 2025-10-30T11:14:00
Path: /overengineered/

**Implementation**: Created directory structure
```bash
mkdir -p overengineered/backend
mkdir -p overengineered/infrastructure
```

**Validation**:
```
drwxrwxr-x  4 mike mike  4 Oct 30 11:14 .
drwxrwxr-x 12 mike mike 27 Oct 30 11:14 ..
drwxrwxr-x  2 mike mike  2 Oct 30 11:14 backend
drwxrwxr-x  2 mike mike  2 Oct 30 11:14 infrastructure
```

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Directories created successfully
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:14:30

### Task 2: Move Backend Lambda Code
Started: 2025-10-30T11:15:00
Path: backend/lambda/ → overengineered/backend/lambda/

**Implementation**: Used git mv to preserve history
```bash
git mv backend/lambda overengineered/backend/lambda
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Files exist at overengineered/backend/lambda/ (functions/, shared/, requirements.txt)
- ✅ Original backend/lambda/ removed
- ✅ Git shows "renamed" for all files (history preserved)

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Move successful, git history preserved
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:15:30

---

### Task 3: Move Infrastructure Code
Started: 2025-10-30T11:16:00
Path: infrastructure/ → overengineered/infrastructure/

**Implementation**: Used git mv to preserve history (corrected nested directory)
```bash
git mv infrastructure overengineered/infrastructure
# Corrected nested structure by moving contents up one level
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Files exist at overengineered/infrastructure/ (environments/, modules/, README.md)
- ✅ Original infrastructure/ removed
- ✅ Git shows "renamed" for all infrastructure files (history preserved)

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Move successful, git history preserved
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:16:30

---

### Task 4: Move Original PRD
Started: 2025-10-30T11:17:00
Path: PRD.md → overengineered/PRD.md

**Implementation**: Used git mv to preserve history
```bash
git mv PRD.md overengineered/PRD.md
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ File exists at overengineered/PRD.md
- ✅ Original PRD.md removed
- ✅ Git shows "renamed" (history preserved)

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Move successful, git history preserved
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:17:15

---

### Task 5: Update Cross-References in README.md
Started: 2025-10-30T11:18:00
Path: README.md

**Implementation**: Updated 3 references to PRD.md
```
Line 16: PRD.md → overengineered/PRD.md
Line 19: PRD.md → overengineered/PRD.md
Line 113: [PRD.md](PRD.md) → [overengineered/PRD.md](overengineered/PRD.md)
```

**Validation**:
```bash
grep -n "PRD\.md" README.md
# All references now point to overengineered/PRD.md
```

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ All cross-references updated
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:18:30

---

### Task 6: Create Explanatory README
Started: 2025-10-30T11:19:00
Path: /overengineered/README.md

**Implementation**: Created comprehensive README explaining engineering judgment
- ⚠️ Prominent warning at top
- Clear explanation of what went wrong (scale assumptions, complexity)
- Portfolio narrative: demonstrates capability + judgment
- Honest but not defensive tone
- Complete context: what was built, what was deferred, why

**Validation**:
- ✅ README exists at /overengineered/README.md
- ✅ Warning is prominent and clear
- ✅ Explanation covers scale assumptions, complexity, timeline
- ✅ Portfolio narrative emphasizes judgment and course correction
- ✅ Tone is educational and mature
- ✅ 2-3 minute read time (estimated)

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Critical deliverable created successfully
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:19:30

---

### Task 7: Final Verification
Started: 2025-10-30T11:20:00

**Implementation**: Ran comprehensive verification checks

**Validation Results**:

*Structure Check*:
- ✅ Backend archived at overengineered/backend/lambda/
- ✅ Infrastructure archived at overengineered/infrastructure/
- ✅ PRD archived at overengineered/PRD.md
- ✅ README exists at overengineered/README.md

*Originals Removed*:
- ✅ Original backend/lambda/ removed
- ✅ Original infrastructure/ removed
- ✅ Original PRD.md removed

*Git History*:
- ✅ 29 files staged as "renamed" (history will be preserved on commit)
- ✅ Git status confirms proper rename tracking

*Cross-References*:
- ✅ All README.md references updated to overengineered/PRD.md

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ All verification checks passed
Completed: 2025-10-30T11:20:30

## Summary
Total tasks: 7
Completed: 7
Failed: 0
Duration: ~6 minutes

**What was accomplished**:

2. ✅ Moved backend/lambda → overengineered/backend/lambda (29 files, history preserved)
3. ✅ Moved infrastructure → overengineered/infrastructure (history preserved)
4. ✅ Moved PRD.md → overengineered/PRD.md (history preserved)
5. ✅ Updated 3 cross-references in README.md
6. ✅ Created comprehensive explanatory README (critical portfolio deliverable)
