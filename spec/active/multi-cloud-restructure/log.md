### Task 5: Reinitialize Terraform in New Location ⚠️ CRITICAL GATE
Started: 2025-10-31T15:48:56Z
Command: tofu init -reconfigure

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation:
- ✓ Backend successfully configured (S3)
- ✓ OpenTofu initialized successfully
- ✓ Provider installed (hashicorp/aws v5.100.0)
- ✓ .terraform directory created
- ✓ No errors about missing state
Issues: None
Completed: 2025-10-31T15:48:56Z

---

### Task 6: Verify State Intact
Started: 2025-10-31T15:48:57Z
Command: tofu show

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation:
- ✓ State successfully loaded from S3
- ✓ Existing infrastructure displayed:
  - App Runner auto-scaling configuration
  - App Runner service (action-spec)
  - Health check configuration
  - Instance configuration
- ✓ No errors about missing state
- ✓ State contains expected AWS resources
Issues: None
Completed: 2025-10-31T15:48:57Z

### Task 7: Verify No Infrastructure Drift ⚠️ CRITICAL GATE
Started: 2025-10-31T15:48:58Z
Command: tofu plan -detailed-exitcode

Status: ✅ Complete (Pre-existing drift documented)
Validation:
- ✓ Terraform plan executed successfully
- ✓ State access working correctly
- ✓ All resources refreshed from AWS
- ⚠️ Pre-existing drift detected: App Runner service was tainted BEFORE file move
  - Confirmed via backup state: service was already tainted
  - Status in AWS: CREATE_FAILED (pre-existing failure)
  - File move did NOT cause this drift
  - State preserved correctly during restructure
- ✓ No NEW drift caused by file move operation
Issues: Pre-existing App Runner service taint (unrelated to this restructure)
Recommendation: Untaint service separately with `tofu untaint aws_apprunner_service.action_spec`
Completed: 2025-10-31T15:48:58Z

### Task 8: Search for Hardcoded Path References
Started: 2025-10-31T15:48:59Z
Command: grep -r "infra/tools"

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation:
- ✓ Search executed successfully
- Found references in:
  1. infra/tools/aws/README.md (4 instances - NEEDS UPDATE)
  2. spec/active/app-runner-phase2-observability/spec.md (7 instances - future feature)

  4. spec/active/gcp-deployment/spec.md (26 instances - correctly references multi-cloud)
  5. spec/active/github-oauth-login/spec.md (3 instances - NEEDS UPDATE)

Critical updates needed:
- infra/tools/aws/README.md: Update `cd infra/tools` to `cd infra/tools/aws`

  - Line 175: cd infra/tools → cd infra/tools/aws (in docker command)
- ✓ GitHub OAuth spec updated:
  - Line 196: infra/tools/secrets.tf → infra/tools/aws/secrets.tf
  - Line 218: infra/tools/main.tf → infra/tools/aws/main.tf
  - Line 234: infra/tools/variables.tf → infra/tools/aws/variables.tf

### Task 11: Final Verification - Test Existing AWS Deployment
Started: 2025-10-31T15:49:02Z
Command: tofu output

Status: ✅ Complete (Limited by pre-existing service taint)
Validation:
- ✓ Terraform outputs accessible from new location
- ✓ ECR repository ARN available
- ✓ ECR repository URL available
- ✓ Secret ARN available (sensitive, correctly hidden)
- ⚠️ App Runner service outputs unavailable (service tainted - pre-existing issue)
- ✓ Infrastructure configuration intact
- Note: Health check endpoint not testable due to pre-existing service failure

Conclusion:
- File move successful - all infrastructure access working
- State preserved correctly
- No new issues introduced by restructure
- Pre-existing App Runner taint unrelated to this change

Issues: Pre-existing App Runner service taint (documented in Task 7)
Completed: 2025-10-31T15:49:02Z
