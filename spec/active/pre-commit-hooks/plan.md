# Implementation Plan: Pre-commit Security Hooks
Generated: 2025-10-21
Specification: spec.md

## Understanding

This feature implements local pre-commit validation to catch security violations before they enter Git history. This is the critical "last line of defense" for a public repository where any committed secrets/credentials become effectively permanent.

**Core Requirements:**
- Bash scripts with zero external dependencies
- Scan only staged files for performance (<5 seconds)
- Hard block on violations (security-first)
- Hybrid usage: Git hook OR standalone script
- Clear, actionable error messages with file:line references
- Industry best practices for B2B SaaS security

**Key Design Decisions (from clarifying questions):**
1. ‚úÖ Integrate into existing `security-scan.yml` workflow
2. ‚úÖ Skip all `.example` files (blanket rule for templates)
3. ‚úÖ Relaxed patterns for `.md` files (allow generic examples, block real secrets)
4. ‚úÖ Use `grep -I` to auto-skip binary files
5. ‚úÖ Create README.md with development setup section

## Relevant Files

**Reference Patterns**:
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (lines 33-56) - Existing AWS account ID and private IP pattern checks
  - Shows project's grep patterns and exclusion approach
  - Demonstrates error message format currently in use

**Files to Create**:
- `scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh` - Main validation script with all security pattern checks
- `scripts/install-hooks.sh` - One-command hook installer for developer setup
- `README.md` - Project README with development setup instructions

**Files to Modify**:
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Add new job `pre-commit-validation` that runs the script

## Architecture Impact

- **Subsystems affected**: Developer tooling, CI/CD pipeline
- **New dependencies**: None (pure bash + standard Unix tools)
- **Breaking changes**: None (purely additive)

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Main Pre-commit Validation Script
**File**: `scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh`
**Action**: CREATE

**Pattern**: Reference `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` lines 33-56 for existing grep patterns

**Implementation**:

### Task 2: Create Hook Installer Script
**File**: `scripts/install-hooks.sh`
**Action**: CREATE

**Pattern**: Standard Git hook installation pattern for teams

**Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Colors
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'

# Test re-installation (should prompt for overwrite)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
# Expected: "‚ö†Ô∏è  Pre-commit hook already exists" + prompt
```

### Task 3: Update Security Scan Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
**Action**: MODIFY

**Pattern**: Add new job to existing workflow (lines 26-56 show job structure)

**Implementation**:
Add this job after the `pattern-check` job:

```yaml
  pre-commit-validation:
    name: Pre-commit Hook Validation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run pre-commit checks
        run: ./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
```

**Exact change**:
After line 57 (end of `pattern-check` job), add the new job.

**Validation**:
```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/security-scan.yml 2>/dev/null || python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/security-scan.yml'))"

# Or just check if file is valid YAML
cat .github/workflows/security-scan.yml | grep -q "pre-commit-validation"
echo "‚úÖ Workflow updated"
```

---

### Task 4: Create Project README
**File**: `README.md`
**Action**: CREATE

**Pattern**: Standard B2B SaaS open-source README with security emphasis

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# ActionSpec

> Turn infrastructure specifications into deployable GitHub Actions

[![Security Scan](https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/actions/workflows/security-scan.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/actions/workflows/security-scan.yml)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

**ActionSpec** is an open-source demonstration of YAML-driven Infrastructure as Code, showcasing how specification files can drive GitHub Actions workflows for automated infrastructure deployment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This is a **PORTFOLIO DEMONSTRATION PROJECT** showcasing cloud architecture patterns.

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE**
- Educational and demonstration purposes only
- No warranty or support provided
- You are responsible for all AWS charges
- Review all code before deployment

## üéØ Features

- **YAML specifications drive all infrastructure** - Change a spec file, deploy infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions automation built-in** - GitOps workflow out of the box
- **AWS WAF deployment with one config change** - Security-first design
- **Cost-optimized for demos** - <$5/month passive costs
- **Security-first design** - Automated scanning and pre-commit hooks

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS account (recommend dedicated demo account)
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- AWS credentials configured as repository secrets

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec.git
   cd action-spec
   ```

2. **Install pre-commit hooks** (REQUIRED for contributors)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
   ```

   This installs security validation that runs before each commit to prevent accidental exposure of:
   - AWS credentials and account IDs
   - Private IP addresses
   - Terraform state files
   - Environment configuration

3. **Test the hook**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
   ```

4. **Make changes and commit** - hooks validate automatically
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your changes"
   # Pre-commit hook runs automatically
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

This project implements multiple layers of security validation:

- **Pre-commit hooks** - Local validation before code enters Git history
- **GitHub Actions scanning** - TruffleHog secret detection + pattern validation
- **CodeQL analysis** - Static code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates

See [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) for reporting security issues.

*Built with [claude-spec-workflow](https://github.com/trakrf/claude-spec-workflow)*
```

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check README exists and has required sections
grep -q "Development Setup" README.md && \
grep -q "install-hooks.sh" README.md && \
echo "‚úÖ README has development setup section"
```

### Task 5: Manual Hook Testing
**File**: N/A (testing task)
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
Test the hook against various scenarios to ensure correct behavior:

```bash
# Test 1: Clean commit (should pass)
echo "# Test comment" > test-clean.md
git add test-clean.md
git commit -m "test: clean file"
# Expected: ‚úÖ Passes

# Test 2: AWS Account ID in code file (should block)
echo "account_id = 123456789012" > test-violation.tf
git add test-violation.tf
git commit -m "test: violation"
# Expected: ‚ùå Blocks with "AWS Account ID pattern detected"

# Test 3: AWS Account ID in .example file (should allow)
echo "account_id = 123456789012" > test.tfvars.example
git add test.tfvars.example
git commit -m "test: example file"
# Expected: ‚úÖ Passes (example files skipped)

# Test 4: Generic 12-digit in markdown (should allow)
echo "Use a 12-digit account ID like 123456789012" > test-docs.md
git add test-docs.md
git commit -m "test: docs"
# Expected: ‚úÖ Passes (relaxed for .md)

# Test 5: Real account ID in markdown (should block)
echo "Our account is 252374924199" > test-real.md
git add test-real.md
git commit -m "test: real account in docs"
# Expected: ‚ùå Blocks with "Real AWS Account ID detected"

# Test 6: Private IP in code (should block)
echo 'server_ip = "10.0.1.45"' > test-ip.py
git add test-ip.py
git commit -m "test: private IP"
# Expected: ‚ùå Blocks with "Private IP address detected"

# Test 7: Secret pattern (should block)
echo 'password = "secretvalue123"' > test-secret.js
git add test-secret.js
git commit -m "test: secret"
# Expected: ‚ùå Blocks with "Potential secret detected"

# Cleanup test files
git reset HEAD .
rm -f test-*.{md,tf,py,js}
```

**Validation**:
All tests must behave as expected. Document any edge cases discovered.

---

### Task 6: CI Workflow Validation
**File**: N/A (validation task)
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
Commit the changes and verify the CI workflow runs successfully:

```bash
# Create a test branch to verify CI
git checkout -b test/pre-commit-validation

# Commit all changes
git add scripts/ .github/workflows/security-scan.yml README.md
git commit -m "feat: add pre-commit security hooks

- Create pre-commit-checks.sh with security pattern validation
- Add install-hooks.sh for easy setup
- Integrate validation into security-scan.yml workflow
- Document development setup in README.md

Implements Phase 1 security foundation per PRD.md"

# Push and watch Actions
git push -u origin test/pre-commit-validation

# Monitor the workflow
# Go to: https://github.com/trakrf/action-spec/actions
# Verify: pre-commit-validation job runs and passes
```

**Validation**:
- All three jobs in `security-scan.yml` pass (secret-scanning, pattern-check, pre-commit-validation)
- Workflow completes in <2 minutes
- No false positives reported

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk**: Regex patterns may have false positives or negatives
- **Mitigation**: Conservative patterns that prioritize security over convenience; extensive manual testing in Task 5

**Risk**: Performance degradation on large commits
- **Mitigation**: Only scan staged files; use grep -I to skip binaries; filter by relevant file extensions

**Risk**: Platform differences (macOS vs Linux bash)
- **Mitigation**: Use POSIX-compliant bash syntax; avoid GNU-specific grep flags; test on multiple platforms

**Risk**: Developers bypassing hooks with --no-verify
- **Mitigation**: CI runs the same validation; document that bypass is not recommended; team culture emphasis

## Integration Points

- **GitHub Actions**: New job in `security-scan.yml` runs on all PRs and pushes to main
- **Git Hooks**: Symlink from `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to `scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh`
- **Documentation**: README.md provides setup instructions for new contributors

## VALIDATION GATES (MANDATORY)

**Note**: This feature is pure bash scripting with no TypeScript/build requirements.

**Validation for this feature**:
1. **Script Syntax**: `bash -n scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh` (check syntax)
2. **Script Syntax**: `bash -n scripts/install-hooks.sh` (check syntax)
3. **YAML Validation**: `yamllint .github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (or Python YAML parser)
4. **Manual Testing**: All tests in Task 5 must pass
5. **CI Validation**: Workflow must run successfully in Task 6

**Standard validation commands from spec/stack.md are not applicable** since this is not TypeScript/Node.js code.

After each script creation:
- Run `bash -n <script>` to validate syntax
- Run `shellcheck <script>` if available (optional but recommended)
- Test execution manually

## Validation Sequence

**Per Task**:
- Task 1: Bash syntax check + manual execution test
- Task 2: Bash syntax check + manual installation test
- Task 3: YAML syntax validation
- Task 4: README markdown validation (grep for required sections)
- Task 5: Full manual test suite (all scenarios)
- Task 6: CI workflow green check

**Final Validation**:
```bash
# All scripts are syntactically valid
bash -n scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
bash -n scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Hook can be installed
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Hook catches violations
# (manual test per Task 5)

# CI workflow passes
# (verify in GitHub Actions UI)
```

## Plan Quality Assessment

**Complexity Score**: 3/10 (LOW)

**Confidence Score**: 8/10 (HIGH)

**Confidence Factors**:
- ‚úÖ Clear requirements from spec
- ‚úÖ Similar patterns found in `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (existing grep patterns)
- ‚úÖ All clarifying questions answered with industry best practices
- ‚úÖ Pure bash - no external dependencies or version conflicts
- ‚úÖ Well-defined test scenarios in spec
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No existing shell scripts in repo to reference (new pattern)
- ‚úÖ Extensive validation plan (manual + CI)

**Assessment**: High confidence implementation. The requirements are clear, patterns are straightforward, and validation is comprehensive. Main risk is regex accuracy, mitigated by conservative patterns and extensive testing.

**Estimated one-pass success probability**: 85%

**Reasoning**: Bash scripting is deterministic and well-understood. The spec provides exact patterns to implement. Risk areas are regex edge cases and platform differences, both addressed through testing. The 15% risk accounts for potential false positives/negatives that may require pattern refinement.
