# Implementation Plan: Claude Spec Workflow Setup (Bootstrap)
Generated: 2025-10-20
Specification: spec.md

## Understanding

This bootstrap spec validates that the Claude Spec Workflow (CSW) has been correctly installed and the spec/ directory structure is properly initialized. This is the **first spec** to be shipped through the CSW workflow, serving as both a validation of the setup and an introduction to the workflow itself.

**Key Constraints:**
- This is validation-only, not initialization
- No project files (package.json, vite config, etc.) are created
- Validation commands in stack.md won't actually run (no npm project exists yet)
- Future specs will handle actual project initialization (Vite, React, AWS SAM, OpenTofu, etc.)

## Relevant Files

**Files to Validate (Existence & Content)**:
- `spec/README.md` - Workflow documentation
- `spec/template.md` - Specification template for future features
- `spec/stack.md` - Validation command definitions (TypeScript + React + Vite)
- `spec/SHIPPED.md` - Empty log file for completed features
- `spec/bootstrap/spec.md` - This bootstrap specification
- `spec/csw` - Symlink to CSW scripts

**Files to Create**:
- `spec/bootstrap/plan.md` - This plan (will be created by /plan command)

**No Files to Modify** - Pure validation, no changes needed

## Architecture Impact
- **Subsystems affected**: None (documentation only)
- **New dependencies**: None
- **Breaking changes**: None

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Validate Core Spec Directory Structure
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Verify spec/ directory exists with expected structure
ls -la spec/
# Expected: README.md, template.md, stack.md, SHIPPED.md, bootstrap/, active/, csw
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] `spec/` directory exists
- [ ] `spec/README.md` exists and describes the workflow
- [ ] `spec/template.md` exists with feature template
- [ ] `spec/stack.md` exists with validation commands
- [ ] `spec/SHIPPED.md` exists (may be empty)
- [ ] `spec/bootstrap/` directory exists
- [ ] `spec/active/` directory exists
- [ ] `spec/csw` symlink exists

### Task 2: Validate spec/README.md Content
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Read and verify README contains workflow documentation
cat spec/README.md | grep -i "specification-driven"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] README.md describes the workflow philosophy
- [ ] README.md documents the /plan, /build, /check, /ship commands
- [ ] README.md explains directory structure
- [ ] README.md includes validation standards section

### Task 3: Validate spec/stack.md Configuration
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Verify stack.md contains expected validation commands
cat spec/stack.md
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] stack.md identifies stack as "TypeScript + React + Vite"
- [ ] Lint command defined: `npm run lint --fix`
- [ ] Typecheck command defined: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Test command defined: `npm test`
- [ ] Build command defined: `npm run build`

**Note**: Commands won't actually work yet (no package.json). This is expected and will be addressed in future specs.

### Task 4: Validate spec/template.md Structure
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Verify template has expected sections
grep -E "^## (Metadata|Outcome|User Story|Context|Technical Requirements|Validation Criteria|Success Metrics|References)" spec/template.md
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Template contains Metadata section
- [ ] Template contains Outcome section
- [ ] Template contains User Story section
- [ ] Template contains Context section
- [ ] Template contains Technical Requirements section
- [ ] Template contains Validation Criteria section
- [ ] Template contains Success Metrics section
- [ ] Template contains References section

### Task 5: Validate Bootstrap Spec Itself
**Action**: VALIDATE

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Verify bootstrap spec follows template structure
cat spec/bootstrap/spec.md
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Bootstrap spec exists at spec/bootstrap/spec.md
- [ ] Spec follows template structure
- [ ] Spec has clear outcome defined
- [ ] Spec has validation criteria
- [ ] Spec has success metrics

### Task 6: Document Expected Limitations
**Action**: DOCUMENT

**Implementation**:
Create a validation report noting what works and what's deferred.

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Document that validation commands won't run (no npm project)
- [ ] Document that this is expected behavior
- [ ] Document that project initialization is a future spec
- [ ] Confirm all directory structure requirements are met

## Risk Assessment

**Risk**: Validation commands in stack.md cannot be executed
**Mitigation**: This is expected. Bootstrap validates structure only. Future spec will initialize npm project.

**Risk**: CSW symlink might not work across environments
**Mitigation**: Check symlink target. If broken, document for manual fix.

## Integration Points
- None - this is a standalone validation task
- No store updates, route changes, or config updates needed

## VALIDATION GATES (MANDATORY)

Since this is a validation-only spec with no code changes, traditional validation gates don't apply. Instead:

**After each task:**
- Verify expected files/content exist
- Document any discrepancies
- Confirm understanding of workflow

**Final validation:**
- All required files present
- All required content verified
- Bootstrap spec ready to ship to SHIPPED.md

## Validation Sequence

After each task: Verify files exist and contain expected content
Final validation: Confirm all validation criteria met

**Note**: Lint, typecheck, test, and build commands from stack.md cannot be run because no npm project exists yet. This is expected and documented in the plan.

## Plan Quality Assessment

**Complexity Score**: 3/10 (LOW)
**Confidence Score**: 10/10 (HIGH)

**Confidence Factors**:
✅ Clear requirements from spec
✅ Simple file validation tasks
✅ No code to write
✅ No external dependencies
✅ CSW directory structure already exists
✅ All clarifying questions answered

**Assessment**: This is a straightforward validation task with zero implementation risk. All files exist and simply need verification.

**Estimated one-pass success probability**: 98%

**Reasoning**: The only potential issue is if files don't exist or don't contain expected content, which would indicate CSW installation problems rather than implementation problems. Since directory structure was confirmed during planning, success is nearly guaranteed.
