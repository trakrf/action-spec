Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 6

### Task 1: Validate Core Spec Directory Structure
Started: 2025-10-20 22:06 UTC
Action: VALIDATE

**Validation Results:**
✅ spec/ directory exists
✅ spec/README.md exists
✅ spec/template.md exists
✅ spec/stack.md exists
✅ spec/SHIPPED.md exists (empty, as expected)
✅ spec/bootstrap/ directory exists
✅ spec/active/ directory exists
✅ spec/csw symlink exists and points to /home/mike/claude-spec-workflow/csw

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issues**: None
**Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:06 UTC

---

### Task 2: Validate spec/README.md Content
Started: 2025-10-20 22:07 UTC
Action: VALIDATE

**Validation Results:**
✅ README.md describes "Specification-Driven Development System"
✅ README.md documents /plan, /build, /check, /ship commands
✅ README.md explains directory structure
✅ README.md includes validation standards section

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issues**: None
**Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:07 UTC

---

### Task 3: Validate spec/stack.md Configuration
Started: 2025-10-20 22:08 UTC
Action: VALIDATE

**Validation Results:**
✅ stack.md identifies stack as "TypeScript + React + Vite"
✅ Lint command defined: `npm run lint --fix`
✅ Typecheck command defined: `npm run typecheck`
✅ Test command defined: `npm test`
✅ Build command defined: `npm run build`

**Note**: These commands will not work until an npm project is initialized (future spec).

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issues**: None
**Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:08 UTC

---

### Task 4: Validate spec/template.md Structure
Started: 2025-10-20 22:09 UTC
Action: VALIDATE

**Validation Results:**
✅ Template contains Metadata section
✅ Template contains Outcome section
✅ Template contains User Story section
✅ Template contains Context section
✅ Template contains Technical Requirements section
✅ Template contains Validation Criteria section
✅ Template contains Success Metrics section
✅ Template contains References section

All 8 required sections are present and properly formatted.

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issues**: None
**Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:09 UTC

---

### Task 5: Validate Bootstrap Spec Itself
Started: 2025-10-20 22:10 UTC
Action: VALIDATE

**Validation Results:**
✅ Bootstrap spec exists at spec/bootstrap/spec.md
✅ Spec follows template structure (all 8 sections present)
✅ Spec has clear outcome defined: "Validate CSW installation and commit workflow infrastructure"
✅ Spec has validation criteria (5 items)
✅ Spec has success metrics (4 items)

Bootstrap spec is complete and follows the template correctly.

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issues**: None
**Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:10 UTC

### Task 6: Document Expected Limitations
Started: 2025-10-20 22:11 UTC
Action: DOCUMENT

**Validation Report:**

**What Works:**
✅ CSW directory structure is complete and correct
✅ All required files exist (README.md, template.md, stack.md, SHIPPED.md)
✅ Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
✅ Slash commands are installed and accessible
✅ CSW symlink is valid and points to correct location
✅ Bootstrap spec follows template correctly
✅ Workflow is ready for use

**Expected Limitations (By Design):**
⚠️ Validation commands in stack.md cannot be executed yet
   - Reason: No npm project exists (no package.json)
   - Impact: Cannot run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, etc.
   - Resolution: This is expected behavior for bootstrap validation
   - Next Step: Future spec will initialize npm project with Vite + React

⚠️ No actual codebase exists to validate
   - Reason: Bootstrap validates infrastructure only, not application code
   - Impact: This spec validates CSW setup, not application functionality
   - Resolution: This is the intended scope of bootstrap
   - Next Step: Subsequent specs will build actual application

**What's Deferred to Future Specs:**
📋 Project initialization (Vite + React + TypeScript setup)
📋 AWS SAM configuration
📋 OpenTofu infrastructure as code
📋 GitHub Actions workflows
📋 Application code implementation

**Confirmation:**
✅ All CSW directory structure requirements are met
✅ All documentation is in place and accurate
✅ Bootstrap validation is complete and successful
✅ Team can now use specification-driven development workflow
✅ Ready to ship bootstrap spec to SHIPPED.md

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issues**: None
**Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:11 UTC

## Summary

**Session Completed**: 2025-10-20 22:11 UTC

**Tasks Completed**: 6/6 (100%)
- ✅ Task 1: Validate Core Spec Directory Structure
- ✅ Task 2: Validate spec/README.md Content
- ✅ Task 3: Validate spec/stack.md Configuration
- ✅ Task 4: Validate spec/template.md Structure
- ✅ Task 5: Validate Bootstrap Spec Itself
- ✅ Task 6: Document Expected Limitations

**Validation Results**:
- All required files exist and are properly structured
- All documentation is complete and accurate
- CSW directory structure meets all requirements
- Bootstrap spec follows template correctly
- Expected limitations are documented

**Issues Encountered**: None

**Duration**: ~5 minutes

**Ready for /check**: YES ✅

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/check` to perform pre-release validation
2. Run `/ship` to merge bootstrap spec and update SHIPPED.md
3. Create next spec for project initialization (Vite + React + TypeScript)

## Notes

This bootstrap validation confirms that the Claude Spec Workflow (CSW) has been correctly installed and is ready for use. The validation commands in stack.md are defined but cannot be executed until a future spec initializes the npm project. This is expected behavior and does not indicate any installation issues.

The workflow is now fully operational and the team can begin creating feature specifications using the template and shipping them through the CSW workflow.
